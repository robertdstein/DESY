Events below this are unlikely to be identified correctly because the DEC light is too faint. In the top right- the distribution of the dataset is shown, once all the non-$Q_{DC}$ cuts have been applied. In the bottom left, the BDT score distribution is shown before any cuts. On the bottom right, we see the same distribution after both signal and BDT score cuts are applied.
